# Emulator for the 6502 microprocessor
Emulator for the 6502 microprocessor, found in many computers like the Commodore 64, Apple II, NES, and various Atari's. The microprocessor is cheap (nowadays), relatively simple, and there are a bunch of people who know a lot about the CPU, making it a great canidate for writing an emulator for. All of the information I'm using comes from [here](http://www.obelisk.me.uk/6502/index.html). One day I hpoe to extend this emulator to include a [65C22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C22) to fully emulate [the breadboard computer that Ben Eater made](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH).

The project came from a need to rapidly write and test code for a 65c02-based operating system (will begin work again when the emulator is done!)
